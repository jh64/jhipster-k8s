This project contains a JHipster (6.10.1) generated app (monolith, angular, h2 for dev and
Postgres for prod), with the entity blog.jdl from https://github.com/mraible/jhipster6-demo.

Running the build scripts _buildMe.????.sh will push the image to the local Docker registry.

Kubernetes deployment configuration yaml files are in another github project: https://github.com/jh64/jhipster-k8s.config
